## KPIs and Analytical Queries
KPIs:
1. 2% month-over-month increase in the number of customers taking part in our tournaments compared to the previous month.
2. 2% month-over-month growth in winning prize at our location
Examples of business questions solved with the warehouse:
- What is the impact of prize pool on the number of participants?  
- Which board games attract the most players?  
- Are tournaments on weekends more popular?  
- Does the time of day (morning/evening) influence attendance?
